A: The following tasks can be performed in this environment:

Task 1: Turn on the Faucet
Task Description: Rotate the faucet switch to turn on the faucet.

Reward Function:
```
def compute_reward(env):
    # reward function
    faucet_switch_pose = env.get_pose_by_link_name("faucet", "link_0")
    gripper_pose = env.get_robot_gripper_pose()
    distance_gripper_to_switch = torch.norm(faucet_switch_pose - gripper_pose, dim=-1)
    switch_state = env.get_state_by_joint_name("faucet", "joint_0")
    
    # Calculate the cost as the distance between gripper and switch minus the switch state
    cost = distance_gripper_to_switch - switch_state
    
    # Define a reward based on the cost
    reward = -cost
    
    # Success condition: Faucet is turned on
    target_switch_state = env.get_limits_by_joint_name("faucet", "joint_0")["upper"]
    success = switch_state >= target_switch_state
    
    return reward, success
```

Task 2: Turn off the Faucet
Task Description: Rotate the faucet switch to turn off the faucet.

Reward Function:

    switch_state = env.get_state_by_joint_name("faucet", "joint_0")
    
    # Calculate the cost as the distance between gripper and switch minus the switch state
    cost = distance_gripper_to_switch - switch_state
    
    # Define a reward based on the cost
    reward = -cost
    
    # Success condition: Faucet is turned on
    target_switch_state = env.get_limits_by_joint_name("faucet", "joint_0")["lower"]
    success = switch_state <= target_switch_state
    
    return reward, success
```
